# Project Demonstration
In the project demonstration we have a graphical user interface which will 
show the wave compared to the activation of the classifier to determine the
period of the speech which the classifier has determined to be children's speech
and which it has determined to be adults speech. 

### The Grapical User Interface
This provides the user with the option to either record some speech or to 
select a .wav file to be ran through the classifier. From there the GUI
will update with the wave form giving the user to option to play or pause 
the playback of of the audio file. 

There will also be a graph showing the activiation of the classifier over 
the intervals defined in the program along with an overall classification value 
of the result.
