# This folder contains all of the models of svm configurations i saw fit to save.
Each of these configurations will no doubt be train over different data or with
different kernel functions for libsvm.

## 200a / 197c : 200a197k.mat
The model in this set is called _model_ and it is trained over a very small
subset of data collected from the childes data set and data from radio and podcasts
of adults talking. All data has been cherrypicked in these sets to make working
with it reasonable easy. It is not broad enough to be used in a release but it is
quite simple and useful for testing whilst building.
